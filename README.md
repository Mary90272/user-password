# user-password

## Description


This week my task was to generate a password for the user from 8-128 characters. Plus, the user had the right to choose (Uppercase, lowercase, digits and special characters)
To simplify the task a little, for this I used a checkbox.
the user has the right to choose the total number of characters and just click the checkbox on your preference ( uppercase lowercase digits and special character)
We have 5 variables. which in the future * by the number of checkboxes selected or not selected by the user. using  math floor /math random. It's a clear and fast way to generate password for users.
I've also added css for a more pleasant look on my page.
